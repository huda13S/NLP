    <h2>What is NLP?</h2>
    <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand and interpret human language. This involves analyzing text, speech, and other forms of natural language data in order to derive meaning and perform useful tasks, such as sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech recognition.</p>
    
    <h2>How are sentences represented by NLP?</h2>
    <p>In NLP, sentences are typically represented as vectors, which are mathematical representations of the meaning and structure of a sentence. These vectors are generated using various NLP techniques, such as word embedding, which maps words to high-dimensional vectors based on their contextual usage, and recurrent neural networks, which can model the sequential structure of language.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Natural Language Processing has revolutionized the way we interact with computers and has enabled a wide range of applications that would have been impossible without it. By enabling computers to understand and interpret human language, NLP has opened up new possibilities in areas such as customer service, healthcare, and education, and will likely continue to do so in the future.</p>
